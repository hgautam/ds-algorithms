### Exercises based on arrays

Based mostly on brute force algorithms and some more efficient.

Space and time complexity table for various operations

| Operation | Complexity |
| :-:       | :-:        |
| Accessing an element | O(1) |
| Updatting an element | O(1) |
| Initialize an array | O(n)|
